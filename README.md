# ðŸ§¬ Welcome to the AlphaFold Workshop: Protein-Protein Interaction Predictions

Hello and welcome! ðŸ‘‹  

This repository is part of a hands-on workshop on using `AlphaFold` to predict **protein-protein interactions**. In this guide, you'll learn how to:

- Collect protein sequences
- Prepare them for multimer predictions
- Run AlphaFold on the server and on the HPC
- Analyze the results and structure quality

Whether you're a beginner in structural biology or just trying to automate your protein interaction screening, this walkthrough is for you!

## ðŸš€ Step 1: Get Your Protein Sequences

You can get protein sequences from [UniProt] (https://www.uniprot.org/)
