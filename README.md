# ðŸ§¬ Welcome to the AlphaFold Workshop: Protein-Protein Interaction Predictions

Hello and welcome! ðŸ‘‹  

This repository is part of a hands-on workshop on using `AlphaFold` to predict **protein-protein interactions**. In this guide, you'll learn how to:

- Collect protein sequences
- Prepare them for multimer predictions
- Run AlphaFold on the server and on the HPC
- Analyze the results and structure quality

Whether you're a beginner in structural biology or just trying to automate your protein interaction screening, this walkthrough is for you!

## ðŸš€ Step 1: Get Your Protein Sequences

You can get protein sequences from [UniProt] (https://www.uniprot.org/)

To predict protein-protein interactions using AlphaFold, we need to provide both protein sequences. Each protein is represented by its amino acid sequence (in FASTA format)


- **Target protein:**

	- Dram2_mouse (Q9CR48) 

- **Partner proteins:**

	- Q9DC58
	- O70404
	- Q9CZX7
	- Q6GSS7
	- P61161
	- C0HKE1
	- P31996
	- P17047
	- Q99KI0
	- Q9QY73
	- Q8R143
	- Q922T2
	- Q5SRX1
	- Q91YT8
	- Q91VK4
	- O88384

## ðŸ™Œ Thanks for Participating!

We hope this workshop gives you the confidence to explore and predict protein interactions.

## Happy folding! ðŸ§¬
